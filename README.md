# 🧩 React Hooks Learning Plan (With Internals)

This roadmap provides a deep dive into React hooks, including behind-the-scenes behavior like re-renders, side effects, cleanup, and performance optimization.

---

## 1. 🔁 Understanding Re-Renders in React

- What causes a component to re-render
- How React’s virtual DOM handles updates
- React’s reconciliation process

---

## 2. 🧠 `useState` Deep Dive

- What happens internally when `setState` is called
- Why state updates are asynchronous
- Batching of state updates
- Re-renders triggered by state

---

## 3. ⚙️ `useEffect` – Side Effects & Cleanup

- What side effects are in React
- `useEffect` lifecycle: mount, update, unmount
- Cleanup functions: when and why they run
- Dependency array: how it controls execution
- Infinite loop prevention
- Behind-the-scenes: React's effect queue

---

## 4. 📦 `useRef` – Persistent Values Without Re-render

- DOM access vs persistent storage
- Why changing `ref.current` doesn’t re-render
- Common use cases: input focus, intervals, previous value tracking

---

## 5. 🚀 `useMemo` & `useCallback` – Performance Optimization

- How memoization works
- When to use them and when not to
- Dependency array behavior
- Preventing unnecessary re-renders

---

## 6. 🌐 `useContext` – Global State Simplified

- Context Provider and Consumer under the hood
- Why context triggers re-renders
- Context value stability and memoization

---

## 7. 📊 `useReducer` – Complex State Management

- Behind the scenes: how reducers simulate Redux-style updates
- Why reducers are useful for large state or controlled actions
- Comparison with `useState`

---

## 8. 🧬 React’s Rendering Model Recap

- Mounting vs updating phase
- Commit phase and effect phase
- How React batches and defers updates
- Strict Mode and double rendering in development

> 📚 Each topic will be explored with hands-on examples, real-world use cases, and performance insights.
