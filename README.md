# 🚀 React.js Core Learning Roadmap

This roadmap will guide you step-by-step through learning core React.js concepts. Ideal for beginners to intermediate developers who want to master React fundamentals before moving to advanced tools and libraries.

---

## 🧩 React Fundamentals

- ✅ What is React? Why use it?
- ✅ Setting up the environment (Node.js, npm, Vite or Create React App)
- ✅ JSX syntax and rules
- ✅ Functional Components
- ✅ Props and children
- ✅ State with `useState`
- ✅ Event handling
- ✅ Conditional rendering

---

## 🧱 Component Architecture

- 📁 Component structure and file naming
- 🔄 Props drilling vs composition
- 🧪 Controlled vs uncontrolled components
- 📋 Lists and keys
- 📝 Forms and handling input

---

## 🔧 React Hooks Deep Dive

- 🔄 `useEffect` (side effects, cleanup)
- 📦 `useState` (in-depth)
- 📌 `useRef` (DOM refs, persist values)
- ⚡ `useMemo` and `useCallback` (optimization basics)

---

## 🌐 React Router

- 🧭 Installing and configuring `react-router-dom`
- 🗺️ `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`
- 🔗 Navigating with `Link` and `useNavigate`
- 🧩 Route parameters and `useParams`
- 🧬 Nested routes and layout routes

---

## 🧠 State Management

- ⬆️ Lifting state up
- 💬 Prop drilling issues
- 🌐 `useContext` (basic global state)
- 🧰 When to use third-party state libraries (Redux, Zustand — optional for now)

---

## 🌍 API Handling and Data Fetching

- 🌐 Fetching data using `fetch` and `axios`
- ⚠️ Error handling
- ⏳ Loading states
- 🔄 `useEffect` with async
- 🧠 Basic caching using local state or `useEffect`

---

## ⚙️ Performance & Optimization

- 🔁 Component re-rendering
- 🧼 `React.memo`
- ⚡ `useMemo`, `useCallback` (again with practical use)
- 💤 Lazy loading components (`React.lazy`, `Suspense`)
- ✂️ Splitting code

---

## 🧪 Testing & Deployment

- 🧪 Intro to testing with React Testing Library and Jest
- 🧼 Writing tests for components and events
- 🚀 Hosting options: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
- 🔐 Environment variables and production build

---

> 🧠 **Pro Tip:** Practice each module with small projects. Start small, build often!

Happy Coding! 💻✨
